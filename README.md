# Query_Search_Project
This project takes user queries and calls on an LLM to return the query as a JSON parsed structured.

## Setup Instructions

- To run, make sure Python (3.8+) is installed, then install the Hugging Face Hub client via `pip install huggingface_hub` through your terminal.

- After cloning the github repository, the script can be run by opening the terminal, navigate to the correct dictionary containing the Python script, and run the script using the command: `python file_name.py`.

- Using the CLI you will be prompted to enter a query- type your query and press enter. The script will then call the LLM and output the parsed JSON directly in the terminal.
